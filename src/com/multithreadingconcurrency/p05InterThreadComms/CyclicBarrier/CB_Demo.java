/*
 * Practical Example: Parallel Computation
 * 
 * Let's consider a scenario where a task that can be broken down into
 * subtasks, each executed by a separate thread.
 * After completing their individual subtasks, threads wait for each other to
 * reach a common barrier before moving to the next phase of the task.
 * This kind of situation is ideal for CyclicBarrier.
